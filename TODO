- add concurrency in uncached_pcache_with_btree
  - needs message queue
  - needs overall sys config with dedicated threads, shared state etc
- X add lru frontend
  - also needs msg queue?
- X add sync operations to LRU API (sync_key/sync_keys?/sync_all)
  - maybe add ability to call ops like insert and delete with a "sync"
    flag
  - may also want to have block/continue versions of these eg
    insert(k,v) {T,P} {B,C} where T=transient, P=persistent;
    B=block, C=continue. T typically implies C, although we may want
    to expose when there is a flush of the LRU
- add a wrapper round pcache so we have an active thread parameterized
  over the bi-directional queue from LRU to pcache

- performance
  - c. 200k inserts per sec with no prints and no asserts; can we
    improve further? perhaps look at GC?


- latency depends on the number of outstanding msgs on the queues; so
  we need to keep this low; how to delay user threads? need some sort
  of delay based on size of queues, particularly the lru_dcl queue
