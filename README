* tjr_kv

This is a key value store written in OCaml. It uses the B-tree code
from tjr_btree, but adds an in-memory LRU cache (or just "cache") in
front, and a persistent cache (pcache) between the cache and the
B-tree. The pcache and the B-tree are synchronous: updates are written
directly to disk.
